üéÅ Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [moosolutions][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

Hi,
my Name is Martin üéÖ and this is my third year of Advent of Code[^aoc]. I try to solve all puzzles with [Kotlin][kotlin]. For me, it is a perfect challenge to go deeper into [Kotlin][kotlin]. Normally I use PHP and TypeScript but [Kotlin][kotlin] is a so cool programming language which is why I decided to use [Kotlin][kotlin] again this year to solve all the puzzles.

If you're stuck with Kotlin-specific questions or anything related to this template, check out the following resources:

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] ‚Äì An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
